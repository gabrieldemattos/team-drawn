# Team Draw

This project was developed as a solution for team drawing in a football group. It allows you to perform simple draws or skill-based draws, taking into account the ratings assigned to each player.

The main objective of the project is to solve the problem of randomly and evenly distributing players into teams. Additionally, it serves as an opportunity for study and practice of development using React.

## Features

The application offers two types of draws:

- Simple Draw: Performs team drawing in a purely random manner, without specific criteria for the draw.
- Skill-based Draw: Takes into account the rating of each player (which the user must provide) to balance the teams as best as possible.
- Intuitive interface: The application has a user-friendly interface where you can choose the type of draw, enter the names of the players, set ratings (when applicable), and view the drawn teams.
